Four buttons, four LEDs. What can we make?
I'll paint a symbol on each of the keys; a footprint, a compass, a train, and 
a rocket, representing eras of human exploration

# Awaken
The first script, which I wrote mostly before I started tracking time w Hackatime, 
allows...
- 🦶 Foot: turns on the sun (LED1) with a soft pulse. Press again to turn it off. 
- 🧭 Compass: Starts a slow orbit animation around the sun. Press again to reverse direction! 
- 🚂 Train: LEDs blink in rhythm—either to a steady beat or synced to music via USB. 
-  🚀 Rocket: Launch sequence: LEDs light up in order, then all flash and stay on. 

Named "Awaken" because its the first code I wrote for this board... and each button
becomes a portal to a different era!

# Signal
This one allows for a person to type out MORSE CODE!
- 🦶 Foot: adds a dot to the message
- 🧭 Compass: adds a dash to the message
- 🚂 Train: pressed once, is an inter-letter space. pressed twice is an inter-word space
-  🚀 Rocket: sends the message!

# Orbit
This allows you to set a study timer on the Pioneer!
- 🦶 Foot: adds 5 minutes per press. wraps at 60 mins. LEDs light up at:
    - 5 to 14 min -> LED1
    - 15 to 29 min -> LED1 + LED2
    - 30 to 44 min -> LED1 + LED2 + LED3
    - 45 to 60 min -> all LEDs
- 🧭 Compass: pauses or unpauses the timer. when paused, all the LEDs flash slowly.
- 🚂 Train: flashes all LEDs 3 times, then resets everything. time = 0, LEDs off.
-  🚀 Rocket: starts the timer! before starting, all currently lit LEDs flash twice. then they stay on, and countdown starts.

# Moonlight
This is a nice little nightlight mode for this board, a perfect way to round it out!
There are four modes:
- 🌫️ Mist — unified breathing
- 🌊 Tide — layered wave in and out
- ✨ Firefly — independent LED rhythms
- 🌙 Moonlit — triggered by TRAIN, one LED pulses softly and shifts on press

Here are what the buttons do:
- 🦶 Foot: cycles the brightness between off -> low -> medium -> high
- 🧭 Compass: pauses or unpauses the animation. when paused, the animation is just still at that mode.
- 🚂 Train: starts Moonlit mode. 
-  🚀 Rocket: cycles modes between mist, tide, and firefly
