Four buttons, four LEDs. What can we make?
I'll paint a symbol on each of the keys; a footprint, a compass, a train, and 
a rocket, representing eras of human exploration

# Awaken
The first script, which I wrote mostly before I started tracking time w Hackatime, 
allows...
- ðŸ¦¶ Foot: turns on the sun (LED1) with a soft pulse. Press again to turn it off. 
- ðŸ§­ Compass: Starts a slow orbit animation around the sun. Press again to reverse direction! 
- ðŸš‚ Train: LEDs blink in rhythmâ€”either to a steady beat or synced to music via USB. 
-  ðŸš€ Rocket: Launch sequence: LEDs light up in order, then all flash and stay on. 

Named "Awaken" because its the first code I wrote for this board... and each button
becomes a portal to a different era!

# Signal
This one allows for a person to type out MORSE CODE!
- ðŸ¦¶ Foot: adds a dot to the message
- ðŸ§­ Compass: adds a dash to the message
- ðŸš‚ Train: pressed once, is an inter-letter space. pressed twice is an inter-word space
-  ðŸš€ Rocket: sends the message!
